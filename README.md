## Description
Multiplayer capture the flag with teams over the internet. It is built with [BabylonJS](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) and [MMOS](https://github.com/akrantz01/mmos).<br>**NOTE**: the MMOS server has been stripped of most functionality and converted to NodeJS due to our teacher's request.
